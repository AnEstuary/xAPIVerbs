ADL Experience API Verbs  
  
The Javascript file attaches an ADL object to the window allowing scripts to access the list of ADL Verbs, 
such as experienced, passed, imported and launched. This makes it easy to use the ADL Verbs, just include this 
file in your html and access it using json notation. See usage and examples below.


Usage
-----

- Include the script in your html ```<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/verbs.js"></script>```
- Reference the verbs in javascript using json notation ```ADL.verbs.registered```
